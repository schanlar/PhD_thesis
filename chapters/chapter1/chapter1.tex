    From the early days when astronomers gazed at the night sky to the present era of cutting-edge instruments and sophisticated computational models, our comprehension of the structure and evolution of stars has grown exponentially. Although many fundamental processes are still poorly understood (e.g., the theory of convection and internal mixing, the effects of rotation and magnetic fields), improvements in both the quantity and quality of observational data, coupled with significant progress in theoretical advancements and the adoption of novel computational techniques, have allowed for an enormous expansion and refinement of both the formal and conceptual basis of the subject.

    In this introductory chapter, we investigate the fundamentals of stellar astrophysics, examining how stars evolve from their formation to their eventual transformation into compact stellar remnants. During this exploration, we focus particularly on neutron stars, which hold significant importance in astrophysics. Formed from the remnants of dying stars, neutron stars serve as unique celestial laboratories, providing valuable insights into the nature of matter and the effects of strong gravity. This dissertation aims to contribute to our understanding of neutron stars by investigating the intricate processes that govern their life cycles, with a specific emphasis on their structure and evolution.

    Naturally, it has been necessary to be selective in the material presented. The intention here is to lay the groundwork and provide a succinct overview of key concepts tailored to the dissertation's scope, steering away from an exhaustive exploration of stellar astrophysics principles. However, readers seeking further clarification may find additional resources in classical textbooks that offer extensive coverage across diverse facets of this field \citep[e.g.,][]{Clayton, Prialnik, Eggleton, Kippenhahn, Carroll_Ostlie_2017}.

    \section{A Brief Introduction to Stellar Structure \& Evolution}\label{sec:ch1:intro}
    From humanity's standpoint, stars often appear as timeless entities, seemingly having existed for eternity and destined to persist indefinitely in the vast expanse of the Universe. This perception, however, is an illusion, stemming from the limited time span during which we observe these celestial bodies in relation to their overall lifetime. In reality, stars undergo the complex processes of birth, evolution, and eventual demise within the cosmic landscape, unfolding over timescales beyond human intuition. To comprehend the evolution of stars over time, observational studies inherently rely on short-term measurements taken from extensive populations.
    Consider the analogy of a paleoanthropologist studying the biological and cultural evolution of humans throughout history. With the first appearance of Homo sapiens believed to have occurred approximately \SI{200000}{years} ago, the only viable method for such a study is through the examination of a large population of fossil records and archaeological evidence spanning different evolutionary stages.

    Given a large sample of stars, we may construct the so-called \textit{Hertzsprung-Russell diagram} (H-R diagram), where stars' luminosity is plotted against their effective surface temperature\footnote{It is worth noting that variations of the H-R diagram exist. In alternative forms, the diagram may employ color, magnitude, or spectral type on its axes. For instance, a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) is a variation that plots stars based on their color and magnitude, providing insights into stellar populations and evolutionary stages based on these observable characteristics.}, an example of which can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:hrd_gaia}. This diagram provides a visual representation of stellar characteristics, allowing us to organize and analyze large populations of stars simultaneously. Through the H-R diagram, stars can be classified based on their luminosity, temperature, and evolutionary stage, providing a comprehensive snapshot of various stellar life cycles. Much like the paleoanthropologist's careful examination of diverse fossil records, the H-R diagram offers astronomers a panoramic view of stellar evolution, enabling them to unravel the mysteries embedded in stellar dynamics.

    \begin{figure}[h!]

        \label{fig:hrd_gaia}
    \end{figure}

    Upon a visual inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:hrd_gaia}, it becomes evident that stars are not randomly distributed on the H-R diagram but instead cluster, forming distinct structures primarily based on their masses, chemical composition, and evolutionary stage. The most prominent of these structures is a large collection of stars forming a diagonal stripe known as the \textit{main sequence}. Above the main sequence lies another feature referred to as the \textit{giant branch}, while below the main sequence, stars are distributed on the left-hand side, forming a group of objects known as \textit{white dwarfs}. The presence of these structures on the H-R diagram implies the existence of underlying physical laws governing observational characteristics such as the surface luminosity and temperature, which will hopefully become apparent in the following sections.

    
    \subsection{Stars in Isolation: From Birth to Death}
    This section provides a broad overview of the life cycle of individual stars, encompassing their birth through their eventual demise. While we will touch upon the processes occurring within the stellar interior, such as energy generation mechanisms and mixing, the significant impact of these factors on stellar evolution cannot be fully appreciated within the scope of this section. For this reason, we will provide references to additional resources whenever deemed necessary.
    
    \subsubsection{Star formation}
    The life of a star is the story of a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity and the star's internal pressure. This story begins within giant molecular clouds, an agglomeration of interstellar gas and dust. These molecular clouds are often composed of hydrogen molecules, helium, and trace amounts of other elements\footnote{In astronomy, elements heavier than helium are commonly grouped under the term ``metals'', although this classification doesn't necessarily reflect their chemical properties. The abundance of these heavier elements within celestial structures, such as stars, is quantified by the term ``metallicity''.}, serving as the cosmic nurseries where stars are born (see Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_ophiouchi}).
    Initially, the molecular cloud is in a state of equilibrium, where thermal motions, driven by temperature, work to resist the force of gravity that seeks to collapse the cloud. The interplay between these opposing forces is described by the \textit{virial theorem} which, under the assumption that the cloud behaves as an ideal gas, takes the form:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:virial}
        2E_\mathrm{kin} + E_\mathrm{gr} = 0,
    \end{equation}
    where $E_\mathrm{kin}$ is the kinetic energy and $E_\mathrm{gr}$ is the gravitational potential energy of the system. For as long as this equation holds true, the system will neither expand nor collapse. If the kinetic energy term dominates, then the thermal pressure overcomes the gravitational attraction and the system will expand. On the other hand, if the gravitational potential term dominates, the system will contract on the free-fall (dynamic) timescale:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamical_timescale}
        \tau_\mathrm{ff} \propto (G\bar{\rho})^{-1/2},
    \end{equation}
    i.e., the characteristic time that would take a body to collapse under its own gravity. Here $G$ is the gravitational constant and $\bar{\rho}$ is the average density of the cloud. Owing to the extremely low densities that characterize molecular clouds, the free-fall timescale is of the order of million of years.

    \begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/chapter1/Rho_Ophiuchi_cloud_complex.png}
        \caption{The $\rho$-Ophiouchi cloud complex, one of the closest star-forming regions to our Solar System, located at the constellation of Ophiuchus.

        \label{fig:rho_ophiouchi}
    \end{figure}

    By applying the virial theorem, it can be shown that there exists a critical mass threshold, known as the \textit{Jeans mass} ($M_J$), which characterizes the point at which self-gravity becomes dominant, overcoming thermal pressure. The Jeans mass is expressed by the formula:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:jeans_mass}
        M_J \approx \left(\frac{3}{4\pi \rho}\right)^{1/2} \left(\frac{5k_BT}{G\mu m_H }\right)^{3/2}, 
    \end{equation}
    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the molecular cloud, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\rho$ is the density of the cloud, $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight, and $m_H$ denotes the mass of the hydrogen atom.

    Star formation begins as portions of the molecular cloud undergo gravitational collapse, triggered by small irregularities in the distribution of matter. Such density inhomogeneities may be induced by turbulence or external factors, like shockwaves from nearby supernovae and spiral density waves, ultimately leading to gravitational instabilities. Consequently, the molecular cloud fragments into denser regions, surpassing the Jeans mass. These more condensed areas, known as cloud cores, become the sites where individual stars are born and take shape.

    As a molecular cloud core contracts under the influence of gravity, it undergoes an initial phase of isothermal collapse. This phase results in the formation of a \textit{protostellar disk} and, subsequently, a \textit{protostar} at its center. Material continues to accrete onto the protostar, while the surrounding protostellar envelope gradually dissipates over time. This phase plays a critical role in determining the initial mass and angular momentum of the nascent star.
    Throughout this collapse, the core's temperature remains relatively constant due to efficient cooling mechanisms. However, as the density increases, the opacity of the material undergoes a change. In the early stages, when the core is less dense, it is optically thin, allowing radiation to easily escape. However, as the density rises, the core becomes optically thick, hindering radiation from propagating through the increasingly dense material. This shift in opacity significantly influences the thermal balance within the collapsing core\footnote{During this process, energy is generated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism. The gravitational potential energy liberated due to contraction is radiated away in the form of light.}.
    
    As the core progresses through its evolution, opacity continues to impact its thermal properties. At higher densities, the core transitions from an isothermal collapse to an adiabatic collapse (where cooling can be ignored), leading to a more substantial rise in temperature due to increased opacity. This gives rise to the birth of a protostar within the dense core. The protostar subsequently undergoes further evolution along the Hayashi track\footnote{A trajectory on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram showcasing the thermal evolution of the protostar during contraction until hydrostatic equilibrium is achieved via central nuclear fusion.}, contracting and heating until the conditions are suitable for the ignition of hydrogen in its center ($T_c \sim 10^7\,\text{}K$). The onset of sustained nuclear fusion in the protostar's core results in the establishment of hydrostatic equilibrium and prevents further collapse. A new star has just been born and has joined the main sequence as a \textit{zero age main sequence} (ZAMS) star!
    

    \subsubsection{Evolution during the main sequence}
    During the main sequence phase, all stars exhibit a fundamental set of characteristics that define this stable stage in their evolution. Central to this phase is the process of hydrogen burning in the star's core, which involves fusing hydrogen nuclei together to form helium. This nuclear fusion generates a continuous release of energy, establishing a delicate equilibrium between the gravitational forces 
    and the outward pressure gradient generated by the ongoing fusion reactions.

    Two primary mechanisms govern central hydrogen burning in stars: the proton-proton (pp)-chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. In the pp-chain, predominant in lower-mass stars like the Sun, hydrogen nuclei (protons) undergo a series of fusion reactions, ultimately resulting in the conversion of four protons into one helium nucleus, liberating energy in the process. Although the net reaction can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pp-chain}
        \mathrm{4\,^1H \longrightarrow \,^4He + 2\,e^+ + 2\,\nu_e + Q(\sim 26.7\,MeV)},
    \end{equation}
    it should be noted that this chain of reactions involves various intermediary steps, including the formation of deuterium and helium-3 as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pp_cno}.

    \begin{figure}[th!]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

    \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Schematic illustration depicting the primary mechanisms driving energy generation in main sequence stars. On the left, the proton-proton chain is portrayed, while on the right, the CNO cycle is presented. Credit: \href{https://supernova.eso.org/}{ESO Supernova}.}
        \label{fig:pp_cno}
    \end{figure}
    
    Conversely, in higher-mass stars, the CNO cycle becomes a dominant contributor to central hydrogen burning. This cycle involves catalytic fusion reactions facilitated by carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes acting as catalysts\footnote{The net result of the CNO cycle is the same, regardless of which of these elements initiates the process.}. The CNO cycle is more temperature-sensitive than the pp-chain and becomes increasingly significant in hotter and denser stellar cores. It offers an alternative pathway for hydrogen fusion, enhancing the efficiency of energy production in more massive stars.

    Nevertheless, regardless of the energy generation mechanism, whether it be the pp-chain or the CNO cycle, the temperature and density within the star remain nearly constant until the depletion of hydrogen. The duration of hydrogen burning is determined by the star's mass and luminosity:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:nuclear_timescale}
        \tau_\mathrm{nuc} = \phi f \frac{Mc^2}{L},
    \end{equation}
    known as the \textit{nuclear timescale}, where $M$ is the total mass of the star, $L$ is it's surface luminosity, $c$ is the speed of light, $f$ is the fraction of the total mass of the star that participates in nuclear burning, and $\phi$ is the fractional mass difference of the reaction, i.e., the fraction of the mass that is being converted into energy in each reaction (for hydrogen burning, $\phi \simeq 0.7\%$). Massive stars are vastly more luminous than lower-mass stars; hence, the nuclear timescale on which they burn their hydrogen supplies is of the order of a few million years. On the other hand, the lowest-mass stars may remain in the main sequence for a period that may exceed the current age of the universe. In both cases, however, stars spend most of their lives in this stable phase, which explains the prominence of the main sequence feature on the H-R diagram.
    


    \subsubsection{Evolution after the main sequence}
    After the eventual exhaustion of their energy source, stars that exit the main sequence feature an inert core composed mainly of helium engulfed in a hydrogen-rich mantle. Without the nuclear reactions to provide an outward pressure to counterbalance gravity, the stars' core falls out of equilibrium and begins to contract. As the temperature increases, the conditions become favorable for the ignition of hydrogen in the outer layers surrounding the inert helium core. This external shell burning generates enough energy to cause the layers above it to expand; the radius of the star grows dramatically and it's surface effective temperature decreases, i.e., it appears redder. The star has transformed into a red giant and starts ascending the red giant branch on the H-R diagram.

    In spite that shell hydrogen burning has restored hydrostatic equilibrium by providing support to the outer layers of the star, the inert helium core continues to contract and heat up.
    This transitional stage represents a crucial point in stellar evolution, giving rise to distinct pathways for stars with different masses. In lower-mass stars, the core contracts until electron degeneracy pressure becomes the primary force preventing further collapse instead of thermal pressure. This pressure arises from the Pauli exclusion principle, which prohibits two fermions, such as electrons, from simultaneously occupying the same quantum state. The hydrogen-burning layer above the inert core produces more helium via one of the processes we described earlier. In turn, this helium is accumulated on top of the helium core, allowing it to grow in mass. If the core reaches a critical mass of approximately $0.4\msun$, then the conditions for initiating core helium burning are fulfilled. Because the core is composed of degenerate matter, when the core temperature reaches a critical level, around 100 million Kelvin, a sudden and explosive ignition of helium occurs in a process known as the \textit{helium flash}. This ignition is not gradual like in earlier burning stages; instead, it is rapid and releases an enormous amount of energy. 
    
    The helium flash marks the onset of helium burning, converting helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process\footnote{This is the mechanism in which three helium nuclei (alpha particles) undergo a two-step fusion process, ultimately yielding carbon. Subsequent fusion involves carbon combining with another helium nucleus to generate oxygen.}.
    Although the helium flash is a dramatic event, it does not lead to a visible explosion on the stellar surface. The outer layers of the star absorb the released energy, causing the star to expand and readjust its structure. After the helium flash, the star settles into a more stable phase of helium shell burning, continuing its evolution towards the horizontal branch\footnote{Notice that stars on the horizontal branch may have two energy sources: core helium burning and shell hydrogen burning.} on the H-R diagram. The duration of shell hydrogen burning and core helium burning is very short compared to the duration of the main sequence. This is the reason why there are relatively fewer red giants than main sequence stars.

    In the case of massive stars, the evolution leading up to this stage follows a similar trajectory. The key distinction lies in the fact that their inert helium core meets the criteria for core helium burning before gravitational contraction induces degeneracy. Consequently, the initiation of helium burning in their cores is a more gradual process, without giving rise to a helium flash. From this point onwards, the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars and massive stars becomes significantly different. 
    
    In the aftermath of core helium depletion, if stars possess sufficient mass, they undergo successive burning phases, transitioning from carbon to neon, then oxygen, and finally silicon. However, this burning sequence ceases upon the formation of an iron core at the star's center. Iron-group elements exhibit the highest binding energy per nucleon\footnote{Protons and neutrons are collectively referred to as nucleons, when there is no need to differentiate between them.}, rendering any nuclear reaction involving them endothermic. Consequently, these reactions cannot contribute to the pressure gradient crucial for counteracting gravitational collapse, and all stars that develop such dense iron cores are doomed. The structure of such massive stars during these final stages resembles that of an onion or the concentric rings found in tree barks. Much like the rings in a tree, each stellar layer represents a distinct phase of nuclear burning in the star's evolutionary journey (see Fig.~\ref{fig:stellar_structure}).
    \begin{figure}[hb!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/chapter1/high-mass-star-struct.jpeg}

        \label{fig:stellar_structure}
    \end{figure}
    Sooner than later, the iron core will collapse and trigger a supernova explosion, known as a \textit{core-collapse supernova}, leaving behind a remnant in the form of a \textit{neutron star} or a \textit{black hole}.
    
    Lower-mass stars, on the other hand, have a different fate; since their cores never reach a high enough temperature to initiate carbon burning, they contract, developing a degenerate, inert core composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. The outer envelope, opposing the contraction of the inert core, expands, causing the star to cool as it enters the \textit{asymptotic giant branch} (AGB) in the H-R diagram.
    Simultaneously, strong stellar winds cause the outer layers to expel, forming a \textit{planetary nebula} and exposing the degenerate core. This naked core, known as a \textit{white dwarf}, is the final remnant left behind by such stars and no longer undergoes nuclear reactions but simply gradually cools down by radiating the residual heat.


    \subsubsection{Mixing in stellar interiors}
    The interior of a star is far from quiet. Equipped with a better understanding of how stars evolve, it is time to dive a little deeper into the more intricate dynamical processes that play a crucial role in their evolution. Here we will briefly present four fundamental mixing mechanisms caused by various instabilities.

    One of the most important mixing mechanisms that takes place in the stellar interior is that of \textit{convection}. It occurs when temperature variations across different layers induce density fluctuations, leading to buoyancy-driven fluid flows. This buoyancy-driven motion efficiently transports heavy elements through bulk motions, a phenomenon known as \textit{dredge-up}, leading to the redistribution of material and energy. Essentially, a heated fluid parcel ascends due to buoyancy forces, while a colder parcel descends, taking its place. This convective process profoundly influences the star's structure, impacting phenomena like nucleosynthesis and magnetic field generation. Figure~\ref{fig:sun_granulation} depicts the granulation on our Sun's photosphere---a prominent illustration of the consequences of convection.
    
    \begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/chapter1/sun_granulation.png}
        \caption{A captivating view of the Sun's photosphere revealing distinct granulations scattered across its surface. In the center, a large black sunspot stands out, its darkness attributed to a lower temperature caused by intense magnetic fields that disrupt the convective transfer of heat. This stark contrast highlights the dynamic interplay of convective processes and magnetic fields on the solar surface. Credit: \href{https://nso.edu/}{NSO/AURA/NSF}.}
        \label{fig:sun_granulation}
    \end{figure}

    The stability of a layer against convection is determined by the \textit{Ledoux} criterion:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:ledoux}
        \nabla_{\text{rad}} < \nabla_{\text{ad}} - \frac{\phi}{\delta} \nabla_{\mu}\,.
    \end{equation}
    In the case of chemically homogeneous layers ($\nabla_{\mu} = 0$), reduces to the \emph{Schwartzschild} criterion:	
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:schwarzschild}
        \nabla_{\text{rad}} < \nabla_{\text{ad}}\,.
    \end{equation}
    Here, $\nabla_\mathrm{rad}$ represents the radiative temperature gradient describing the logarithmic temperature variation with depth when energy is transported by radiation, $\nabla_\mathrm{ad}$ is the adiabatic temperature gradient defined similarly to $\nabla_\mathrm{rad}$ but for adiabatic compression or expansion, and $\nabla_\mu$ is the composition gradient accounting for variations in chemical composition within the medium.
    
    Modeling convection in astrophysical contexts is a notoriously difficult problem and poses significant challenges due to the complex, turbulent nature of convective flows. The inherent nonlinearity and multiscale behavior of convective processes make their accurate representation in numerical simulations demanding. One widely employed approach is the \textit{Mixing Length Theory} (MLT), which simplifies convective dynamics by introducing a characteristic length scale to describe the convective cells' average size and behavior. While MLT has been successful in certain applications, it has limitations in capturing the full complexity of convection, especially in regions with varying conditions. As a result, convection is often treated as a diffusive process in computational models, wherein the convective transport of energy, momentum, and chemical species is approximated using diffusion equations. This simplification facilitates numerical simulations but may overlook finer details of convective behavior, introducing a lot of uncertainties in our stellar evolution models.

    Another mixing process observed in stellar interiors is called \textit{semi-convection}, which is characterized by an intermediate state between full convection and radiative diffusion. This phenomenon occurs in regions where convective instability interacts with stratified layers, i.e., in regions that are stable to Ledoux criterion but unstable to Schwarzschild \citep[see][]{spruit:semiconvection}. Semi-convection contributes to the transport of both chemical elements and angular momentum, influencing the internal rotation profiles of stars and impacting their overall evolution.

    As we mentioned, the boundaries of a convective zone are determined by the Ledoux or Schwarzschild criteria. Nevertheless, \textit{convective overshooting} extends the impact of convective zones beyond their formal boundaries. As convective cells reach the boundaries of a convective region, they may overshoot and penetrate into adjacent stable layers due to their inertia until they lose all of their momentum. This overshooting process has implications for the extent of mixing in the stellar interior, affecting the transport of elements and altering the size of convective cores in evolving stars.
    
    Last but not least, in certain stellar environments, a phenomenon known as \textit{thermohaline} mixing manifests when there is a decrease in molecular weight with depth. This scenario often arises in binary systems undergoing accretion, creating stratified layers such as a helium layer overlying a hydrogen-rich one. As a consequence, the heavier elements tend to sink while the lighter materials ascend, leading to a restructuring of the mean molecular weight.

    

    \subsubsection{Stellar rotation}
    Thus far, we have silently operated under the assumption that the overview of stellar evolution provided relates solely to spherically symmetrical, nonrotating stars. However, rotation constitutes a crucial factor that profoundly impacts the evolution of stars and deserves to be discussed separately. 

    The inclusion of rotation introduces an---even more---dynamic aspect to stellar evolution, influencing various processes such as angular momentum transport, magnetic field generation, and the overall structure of a star. As stars form from rotating molecular clouds, the conservation of angular momentum plays a pivotal role in shaping their subsequent evolution. The rotation rate affects the size, shape, and internal distribution of matter within a star, influencing its overall stability and lifespan.

    Rotation induces various instabilities that significantly influence the mixing processes and internal dynamics of stars. The Eddington-Sweet circulation, for instance, arises due to the interaction between rotation and density gradients, leading to meridional flows that impact the transport of heat and various isotopes within the stellar interior. The dynamical shear instability and secular shear instability are additional rotational instabilities that can affect the internal shear profile of a star, influencing its overall stability and evolution. Additionally, the interplay between rotation and magnetic fields gives rise to phenomena like the solar dynamo, influencing the generation and modulation of the star's magnetic activity.

    Understanding the role of rotation-induced instabilities in stellar evolution is crucial for deciphering the observed diversity in stellar properties and behaviors. As stars age, their rotation rates can change due to processes like stellar winds and mass loss, further impacting their evolution. Therefore, a comprehensive exploration of stellar evolution necessitates a detailed examination of the influence of rotation and the associated instabilities.

    \subsubsection{Stellar winds}
    The interior of a star is not the only site of great turmoil that determines its evolution. The surface of a star is also a violent environment that can influence its surroundings beyond its own luminous boundaries. One fundamental phenomenon within this narrative is that of \textit{stellar winds}---the continuous flow of gas and charged particles ejected from the upper atmospheres of stars. For single stars, stellar winds are a primary factor in mass loss, especially in the later stages of their lives, affecting their mass, luminosity, and size over time. To make things even more interesting, these winds also contribute to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium, as material from the star is dispersed into space.

    The intensity and composition of stellar winds depend on factors such as the star's mass, temperature, and evolutionary stage. For massive stars, such as O-type and B-type stars, mass loss is primarily driven by radiation pressure, where photons exert a force on the star's outer layers, propelling them outward. These winds can be extremely powerful, capable of removing significant portions of the star's mass over its lifetime.
    This process is less significant in lower-mass stars, such as the Sun, where stellar winds are driven by other mechanisms, such as magnetic fields and acoustic waves interacting with the stellar atmosphere. In this case, stellar winds are less intense but still contribute to the star's mass loss and the shedding of angular momentum, impacting the star's rotation rate, particularly during the red giant phase. Overall, the effect of stellar winds is evident in the H-R diagram, where stars that have lost significant mass through stellar winds occupy different positions than they would have otherwise.

    Empirical relations have been established to quantify mass loss rates from the observational spectra of stars. Observations at various wavelengths, from X-ray to radio, allow us to study the properties of stellar winds, including their speed, density, and composition. One of the key empirical relations is the correlation between the star's luminosity and its mass loss rate, often expressed in the form of power laws. These relations are derived from observations of spectral lines that are sensitive to the velocity and density of the wind. For example, the P Cygni profiles observed in ultraviolet spectra are indicative of strong stellar winds in massive stars \citep[e.g.,][]{israelian:ssr99}. These empirical relations are critical for modeling the evolutionary tracks of stars, as they provide a means to incorporate mass loss due to stellar winds into stellar evolution codes.

    

    \subsection{Stellar Remnants in a Nutshell}\label{sec:ch1:remnants}
    Following the cessation of nuclear fusion, stars transition into one of three possible end states: white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes, depending on their initial mass and subsequent evolutionary pathways. This section provides an overview of the distinct characteristics and the mechanisms behind the formation of these stellar remnants. Notably, while all three end states are introduced here, a comprehensive examination of neutron stars---the primary subject of this dissertation---is reserved for a subsequent section. Here, we lay the groundwork for that detailed discussion, setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of neutron stars' composition, equation of state, and internal structure, alongside the challenges and uncertainties that accompany these topics, in Sect.~\ref{sec:ch1:ns_struct}.
    
    \subsubsection{White Dwarfs}
    White dwarfs are formed from the remnants of stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. As presented in the previous section, a star burns through its hydrogen in a process known as nuclear fusion, creating helium and later heavier elements up to iron in more massive stars. Once the nuclear fuel is depleted, and if the star's mass is below approximately $8\msun$, it will not undergo a supernova explosion. Instead, it sheds its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula, while the core contracts under gravity. This core remnant is what we call a white dwarf. It is characterized by its incredibly dense composition, primarily consisting of carbon and oxygen, which results from the fusion of helium in its final burning phase.  In some cases, particularly in more massive white dwarfs that have a mass closer to the Chandrasekhar limit (see below), heavier elements like neon and magnesium can be found.

    In the absence of significant thermonuclear reactions, their energy emission is solely due to the residual thermal energy left over from the star's previous nuclear burning phase, which gradually radiates away, causing the white dwarf to cool and dim over time\footnote{The low-temperature, low-luminosity of aged white dwarfs is the reason they occupy the lower left corner in the H-R diagram.}. However, without thermonuclear reactions to provide the necessary pressure gradient to support white dwarfs against gravity and establish hydrostatic equilibrium, one may wonder how these objects exist. The short answer is that the structural integrity of a white dwarf is achieved through electron degeneracy pressure rather than the thermal pressure found in most stars. 

    \begin{figure}[th!]

    \end{figure}
    
    In the dense core of a white dwarf, electrons are packed so closely together that they are forced into a state of degeneracy, a quantum mechanical effect that arises from the Pauli exclusion principle. This degeneracy pressure is described by a polytropic equation of state, which can be approximated by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:polytropic_eos}
        P \simeq K \rho^\gamma,
    \end{equation}
    where $\rho$ is the density of the matter, $K$  is a constant that depends on the mass and charge of the electrons, and $\gamma$ is the polytropic index that assumes the value of $5/3$ or $4/3$ for the case of a nonrelativistic and a relativistic electron gas, respectively. A more detailed discussion on the derivation of the equation of state in an ideal quantum gas is given in Appendix~\ref{apx:eos}.
    Following Eq.~\eqref{eq:polytropic_eos}, it is evident that the pressure originating from degenerate matter is independent of temperature, contrasting sharply with the thermal pressure in ideal gases, which is dependent on both temperature and density. As a result, white dwarfs do not expand or contract in response to cooling in the same way that normal stars do.

    The unique state of matter in white dwarfs leads to a counter-intuitive mass-radius relation, where more massive white dwarfs have smaller radii:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m-r_wd}
        R \propto M^{-1/3} \longrightarrow M\cdot V = \text{constant.}
    \end{equation}
    This inverse relationship is a direct consequence of electron degeneracy pressure\footnote{Similar relationship exists for the case of neutron stars where the exerted pressure originates from the degeneracy of neutrons instead of electrons.}. As the mass increases, the core must contract to maintain enough degeneracy pressure to counteract gravity, leading to a smaller (in volume) white dwarf. However, there is a limit to this process; as the core contracts, the available space for electrons to move becomes smaller. Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, this means the momentum (velocity) of electrons should increase. But there is a clear upper limit on what the maximum speed of an electron could be---the speed of light. This translates that there is a maximum mass (minimum volume) that a white dwarf might attain before electron degeneracy pressure fails. The maximum mass of a white dwarf is called \textit{Chandrasekhar mass} limit:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:chandra_limit}
        M_\mathrm{Ch} \approx 1.4\msun\,.
    \end{equation}
    Although the exact value of the Chandrasekhar limit is influenced by the composition of the white dwarf, magnetic fields, and rotation, it clearly represents a fundamental threshold beyond which electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to support the star against gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of a neutron star or a black hole \citep[for a more extensive overview of white dwarfs we refer to ][]{blouin2024}.


    \subsubsection{Neutron Stars \& Pulsars}
    Neutron stars primarily form from the remnants of massive stars following a supernova explosion. This process begins when a star with a mass between approximately $8$ and $25\msun$ exhausts its nuclear fuel, leading to the collapse of its core. As the core collapses, its density increases dramatically, causing protons and electrons to merge into neutrons via inverse $\beta$-decay. This results in a neutron-dense object with an incredibly high density (much higher than white dwarfs), supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure. 
    Moreover, neutron stars can form through a different pathway involving white dwarfs in binary systems. When a white dwarf accretes material from its companion star, its mass may increase. If the white dwarf's mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, it can undergo a type Ia supernova (see Sect.~\ref{sec:ch1:transients}) or collapse into a neutron star. This process is less common and depends on specific conditions within the binary system, such as the mass transfer rate and the initial mass of the white dwarf.

    Just as white dwarfs have the Chandrasekhar limit, neutron stars have an upper mass limit known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit, though not as precisely defined as the Chandrasekhar limit due to uncertainties in the equation of state for neutron star matter, is theorized to be between 2 and 3\msun. Beyond this limit, the neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to counteract the gravitational force, leading to further collapse into a black hole. The exact value of the TOV limit depends on the properties of nuclear matter at extremely high densities, which are still a subject of active research.

    Finally, one of the most striking manifestations of these compact objects are pulsars. These are a specific type of neutron star that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles. As pulsars rotate, these beams sweep across space, and if Earth lies within the path of these beams, we observe pulses of radiation at regular intervals. These pulses can be extremely regular and are observed across various wavelengths, including radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray.

    \subsubsection{Black Holes}
    \resetinlineenum
    The existence of a maximum mass threshold for the stability of neutron stars raises the question of what happens if: \inlineitem a star loses a significant portion of its mass yet its remaining core exceeds \numrange{8}{10}\msun, or \inlineitem a neutron star gains additional mass, surpassing the critical limit of roughly $3\msun$.  It's reasonable to infer, by analogy with white dwarfs that exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and subsequently collapse into neutron stars, that any degenerate object surpassing the TOV limit would undergo collapse into a more compact form. However, in such instances, no known physical mechanisms exist that could halt the collapse and restore a state of hydrostatic balance. As a result, the star would continue to collapse until its matter is compressed into a singularity---a point with no volume and infinite density, marking a boundary where conventional physics breaks down. These extraordinary objects are known as black holes.

    The formation of a black hole as a result of the total gravitational collapse of a star represents one of the most striking predictions of general relativity and modern stellar evolution theory. The precise relativistic description of gravitational collapse and the mathematical properties of black holes, naturally, are beyond the scope of this thesis. However, in what follows, we will present the basic concepts that give rise to the simplest form of a black hole: the Schwarzschild black hole.

    \end{figure}

    Within the framework of general relativity, gravity is portrayed not as a force acting at a distance but as the warping of spacetime caused by the localized distribution of mass, according to Einstein's field equations:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:gr_field_equation}
        R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu}, 
    \end{equation}
    where $R_{\mu \nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $g_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric tensor describing the geometry of the spacetime manifold, $R$ is the scalar curvature, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant\footnote{The cosmological constant was introduced by Einstein to allow for a static universe (though he later considered it his ``biggest blunder'' after the expansion of the universe was discovered). It is now understood to be related to dark energy.}, $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum. Although Eq.~\eqref{eq:gr_field_equation} appears simple it is in fact highly nonlinear and very difficult to solve. Nonetheless, we can impose some restrictions and explore a particularly intriguing subset of solutions to Einstein's field equations: \textit{the vacuum solutions}. These solutions emerge under conditions where the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$ is equal to zero, indicating regions of spacetime where matter or any form of energy is absent. Mathematically, this scenario simplifies Einstein's field equations to:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:vacuum_solutions}
    R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0,
    \end{equation}
    by setting the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:gr_field_equation} to zero, reflecting the absence of mass-energy sources. These vacuum solutions are critical for understanding the pure gravitational field's geometry, particularly in contexts where the influence of matter can be neglected. Moreover, if we assume that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is also zero, Eq.~\eqref{eq:vacuum_solutions} reduces further to:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:vanishing_ricci}
        R_{\mu \nu} = 0\,.
    \end{equation}
    
    Applying some tensor calculus, allow us to derive a particular vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations, called the \textit{Schwarzschild solution}', that describes the spacetime geometry surrounding a spherically symmetric, nonrotating, and uncharged mass\footnote{The study of more complex systems that consider rotation and/or electric charge lead to other vacuum solutions, such as the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions.}. Assuming a Lorentzian signature $(- + + +)$ of the metric, the spacetime interval\footnote{A scalar quantity that generalizes the notion of distance from Euclidean space to curved spacetime. Also often called ``line element'', ``metric interval'' or simply ``metric''.} of the Schwarzschild solution is given by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:schwarzschild_metric}
        ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)c^2dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2),
    \end{equation}
    where $M$ is the mass of the object, $r$ is the radial coordinate, $t$ is the time coordinate, and $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the angular coordinates. 
    Often it is more convenient to express the Schwarzschild metric using the metric tensor, $g_{\mu \nu}$, in spherical coordinates:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:schwarzschild_metric_matrix}
        g_{\mu\nu} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & r^2 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & r^2\sin^2\theta \\
        \end{pmatrix},
    \end{equation}
    so that Eq.~\eqref{eq:schwarzschild_metric} can be written as:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:schwarzschild_metric2}
        ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu,
    \end{equation}
    where $dx^\mu = (dt, dr, d\theta, d\phi)$ are the components of the spacetime coordinates\footnote{Here the Einstein summation convention is implied, which means that when an index variable appears twice in a single term, once in an upper (contravariant) position and once in a lower (covariant) position, it signifies a sum over all possible values of that index.}.
    The components of the metric tensor for the Schwarzschild solution illustrate in a concise manner how distances and times are altered due to the presence of a massive object: The time component, $g_{00} = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)$, indicates the time dilation due to gravity; the radial component, $g_{11} = \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}$, shows the spatial distortion near the massive object; the angle components, $g_{22} = r^2$ and $g_{33} = r^2\sin^2\theta$, reflect the spherical symmetry of the spacetime around the massive object. 

    So far, in our discussion on the Schwarzschild solution, we have never mentioned black holes explicitly. In fact, all solutions stemming from Eq.~\eqref{eq:gr_field_equation} are not limited to describing black holes but are relevant to \textit{any} mass distribution. They are being used in a wide variety of applications, from calculating the precession of planetary orbits to improving the accuracy of the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, one may notice that the coefficient of the radial component of the metric tensor becomes infinite when:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:schwarzschild_radius}
        r = r_s \equiv \frac{2GM}{c^2},
    \end{equation}
    which indicates a point of no return. This radius is called the \textit{Schwarzschild radius} and defines the boundary of a black hole, known as the \textit{event horizon}. Inside this radius, the spacetime curvature is so extreme that all paths, space-like and time-like, lead inevitably towards the singularity at the center. In other words, any matter or radiation falling past the event horizon is irrevocably drawn into the central singularity, effectively making them invisible and detectable only by their gravitational effects on surrounding matter and radiation.

    Until very recently, the only observational confirmation of the existence of black holes were based on indirect evidence such as accretion disks and the associated X-ray emissions, gravitational lensing, and the orbital motion of stars near the center of galaxies. However, the detection of gravitational waves in September 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has provided direct evidence of black holes and, notably, black hole mergers \citep{LIGO:BHmerger}. Moreover, in April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope\footnote{The EHT uses very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) techniques to achieve the necessary resolution to observe the event horizon's ``shadow'' against the backdrop of the glowing gas in the accretion disk.} (EHT) released the first-ever ``image'' of a black hole's event horizon, or more accurately, the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy M87 as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:m87_bh}. This image provided direct visual evidence of a black hole's existence, showcasing a central dark region (the shadow) surrounded by a ring-like structure of light emitted by particles accelerated in the intense gravity near the event horizon \citep{EHT:M87}. Both LIGO and EHT observations were monumental confirmations of the predictions made by general relativity regarding the nature of black holes and their impact on surrounding spacetime and matter.

    \subsection{Binary Evolution}\label{sec:ch1:binaries}
    The evolution of stars in binary systems represents a complex process that differs significantly from the evolution of single stars. When two stars are gravitationally bound in a binary system, they orbit around a common center of mass. This close relationship leads to interactions that can significantly change their evolutionary paths. These interactions may include the transfer of mass from one star to the other, phases where both stars share a common outer layer, and even situations where the two stars merge. Such processes can change the way stars evolve, leading to outcomes that are not seen in the evolution of solitary stars. For instance, binary systems can give rise to phenomena like X-ray binaries, blue stragglers, and type Ia supernovae. These phenomena are important for our understanding of how galaxies evolve and how we measure distances in the universe. In this section, we will explore how the presence of a companion star influences the evolution of stars, highlighting the key differences from the evolution of single stars.
    \subsubsection{Orbital Dynamics}
    The foundation for understanding these systems lies in the \textit{restricted three-body problem}, which simplifies the dynamics by considering the gravitational effects of two massive bodies on a third, infinitesimally small mass. The gravitational potential in the vicinity of two massive bodies forms the basis for understanding the motion of stars in a binary system. The potential at any point in space is a function of the distances to each mass, leading to a scalar field that describes how the gravitational force varies across space. Mathematically, the effective gravitational potential $\Phi$ in a rotating frame of reference for a two-body system with masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ is given by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:gr_potential}
        \Phi = -G \left(\frac{M_1}{r_1} + \frac{M_2}{r_2} \right) - \frac{1}{2}\Omega^2 r_3^2,
    \end{equation}
    where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distances to the center of the stars $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively, $\Omega$ is the orbital angular velocity, and $r_3$ is the distance to the rotational axis of the binary. The equation of motion for a test particle within this effective gravitational field, considering only gravitational and centrifugal forces, can be derived from the gradient of the potential expressed by Eq.~\eqref{eq:gr_potential}.  In a rotating frame, the force experienced by a particle is given by the negative gradient of the effective potential:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:equation_of_motion1}
        \pmb{F} = -\nabla \Phi \Rightarrow m\frac{d^2 \pmb{r}}{dt^2} = -\nabla \Phi,
    \end{equation}
    where $m$ is the mass of the test particle. Expanding the gradient $\Phi$, we get:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:equation_of_motion2}
        m \frac{d^2 \pmb{r}}{dt^2} = -G \left( \frac{M_1 (\pmb{r} - \pmb{r}_1)}{|\pmb{r} - \pmb{r}_1|^3} + \frac{M_2 (\pmb{r} - \pmb{r}_2)}{|\pmb{r} - \pmb{r}_2|^3} \right) - \Omega^2 \pmb{r}_3
    \end{equation}
    
    Setting the condition that the sum of forces acting on the test particle reduces to zero, i.e., $\nabla \Phi = 0$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:equation_of_motion2} leads to the identification of five equilibrium points. These stationary solutions are known as \textit{Lagrange points}, named after the Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who first described them in 1772. The five points, designated as $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, $L_4$, and $L_5$, represent positions where a small mass can maintain a stable or quasi-stable equilibrium due to the balancing of the gravitational forces from the two larger masses and the centrifugal force (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_sur}).

         \label{fig:eq_sur}
    \end{figure}

    The stability of these points varies, with $L_4$ and $L_5$ generally being more stable due to the configuration leading to a potential well where objects can remain even when slightly perturbed. In contrast, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$ are saddle points in the gravitational potential, where stability is more delicate and dependent on the specific dynamics of the system \citep[e.g.,][]{Szebehely, Celletti1990, Schwarz2012}. 

    \subsubsection{Mass Loss}
    Among the five Lagrangian points, $L_1$ is crucial in the dynamics of binary star systems since the equipotential surface passing through that inner point, defines the \textit{Roche lobe}. The configuration of these equipotential surfaces, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_sur}, assume a concentric spherical shape in proximity to the two massive bodies. However, the mutual gravitational forces of the two masses distort these surfaces, elongating them as the distance from the bodies increases. As stars undergo various phases of their life cycles, they may experience significant expansion, increasing their radii to the extent that they surpass the boundaries of their respective Roche lobes. When this occurs, the gravitational equilibrium is disrupted, leading to the flow of stellar material from the inflated star to its companion through the $L_1$ Lagrange point\footnote{Depending on the evolutionary stage of the donor star at the onset of mass transfer, we can discern three main cases: Case A occurs during the main sequence phase, Case B happens after the donor star has left the main sequence but before helium ignition, typically during the RGB phase, and Case C refers to mass transfer initiated after helium has been ignited in the core of the donor star, often during the AGB phase. Additionally, further sub-classifications, such as Case BA or Case BB, exist to describe more specific evolutionary stages and mass transfer scenarios within these broad categories.}. This phenomenon, driven by the differential pressure forces, is termed \textit{Roche lobe overflow} (RLOF). During RLOF, the donor star may lose a considerable portion of its mass, significantly influencing the mass distribution and evolutionary path of the binary system \citep[e.g.,][]{temmink:aa23}.

    When matter spills across the inner Lagrange point, it carries its own angular momentum, which is determined by its orbital motion around the companion star before accretion. What happens next depends on the details of the system, such as how the stars move together and the type of the companion star. 
    If the matter moving towards a companion star carries significant angular momentum, it typically cannot directly fall onto the star's surface. The reason is that the angular momentum acts as a barrier, preventing the material from making a straight descent. Consequently, the material starts to orbit the star, leading to the formation of an \textit{accretion disk}. Within this disk, the material gradually sheds some of its orbital angular momentum, which helps it overcome the outward push of the centrifugal force. As a result, the material can move closer to the star and eventually gets accreted onto its surface.
    
    However, not all matter transferred through $L_1$ forms an accretion disk. Sometimes, especially if the companion star is a normal star such as our Sun and not a compact object, the matter might fall directly onto the star. This can happen if the material does not have much angular momentum to begin with or if the orbital motion of the stars within the binary system allows the material to flow straight onto the companion star without needing to orbit it first.

    Although RLOF is of paramount importance in determining the fate of binary star systems, an analytical formula to precisely define the Roche lobes' boundaries for any arbitrary mass ratio and separation distance between the two stars does not exist. The absence of such an expression stems from the highly nonlinear nature of the gravitational potential field surrounding the binary stars that has no exact mathematical solution. Hence, we rely on approximations to estimate the size of the Roche lobes. One such approximation was developed by Peter Eggleton in 1983, through fitting to numerical models and exhibits a remarkable accuracy with a broad range of mass ratios. The Eggleton's empirical formula is given by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:eggleton_formula}
       R_L = \frac{0.49 q^{2/3} a}{0.6 q^{2/3} + \ln(1 + q^{1/3})},
    \end{equation}
    where $R_L$ is the radius of the Roche lobe, $q$ is the mass ratio of the two stars defined as $q\equiv M_\mathrm{donor}/M_\mathrm{accretor}$, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the binary system's orbit.

    In concluding this section, it is important to mention that based on how matter fills their equipotential surfaces, binary star systems can be classified into three main categories: \textit{detached binaries}, \textit{semi-detached binaries}, and \textit{contact binaries}. In detached binaries, both stars are comfortably within their respective Roche lobes, with no mass transfer occurring between them; their equipotential surfaces are not filled to the point of overflow, allowing each star to evolve independently. Semi-detached binaries feature one star that fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to its companion, which does not fill its own Roche lobe; this setup leads to a dynamic interaction where one star significantly affects the evolution of the other. Contact binaries are even more intimately connected, with both stars filling their Roche lobes to the extent that their outer equipotential surfaces are in contact, allowing for the transfer of mass between the stars and often resulting in shared outer envelopes.

    \subsubsection{Angular Momentum Loss}
    Angular momentum plays a pivotal role in the evolution of binary star systems, influencing their orbital dynamics, mass transfer processes, and ultimate fate. Various mechanisms can lead to angular momentum loss, significantly impacting the separation between the components, the mass transfer rate, and the evolution of the system as a whole. Next we discuss some notable mechanisms relevant to binary systems.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Nonconservative mass transfer}
        
        In binary star systems, mass transfer from one star to another is a common occurrence, especially when one of the stars fills its Roche lobe. While this process can lead to angular momentum redistribution within the system, part of the mass---and consequently, angular momentum---may be lost to the system entirely. This happens in nonconservative mass transfer scenarios, where the transferred mass can be ejected from the system through stellar winds or jets, or form a circumbinary disk that eventually disperses the material into space. In the latter case, interaction between the binary and the disk can lead to angular momentum being transferred from the binary to the disk, effectively removing angular momentum from the system. The loss of mass and angular momentum through these processes can cause the binary components to spiral closer together or, in some cases, result in an increase in orbital separation, depending on the specific dynamics and mass ratios of the system.

        \item \textit{Magnetic braking}

        Magnetic braking is another significant mechanism for angular momentum loss, particularly relevant in close binary systems containing at least one star with a strong magnetic field. As the star rotates, its magnetic field interacts with the stellar wind. This interaction transfers angular momentum from the star to the stellar wind, which then carries it away as it escapes into space. Over time, magnetic braking can lead to a decrease in the rotation rate of the star and a gradual tightening of the binary orbit, as the loss of angular momentum from the system causes the stars to move closer together \citep[e.g.,][]{Gossage_2023}.

        \item \textit{Tidal friction}
        
        In close binary systems, tidal forces can lead to the synchronization of rotation periods with the orbital period and the circularization of orbits. These tidal interactions can redistribute angular momentum within the system, leading to a net loss as the system evolves towards equilibrium. Tidal friction can cause internal angular momentum to be converted into heat, gradually slowing the rotation of the stars relative to their orbital motion.

        \item \textit{Gravitational waves}

        In the weak gravity limit, a regime in which the gravitational field is sufficiently weak that the spacetime can be approximated as flat, the spacetime metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ is approximated as a small perturbation $h_{\mu \nu}$ on the flat Minkowski spacetime $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:weak_gravity_limit}
            g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu},\quad \text{with}\quad |h_{\mu \nu}| \ll 1\,.
        \end{equation}
        This approximation allows the complex, nonlinear Einstein field equations to be linearized, simplifying the analysis considerably. Gravitational waves are solutions to these linearized equations\footnote{Unlike the Schwarzschild solution, here we solve the linearized equations with a nonzero stress-energy tensor.}, representing ripples in the fabric of spacetime that propagate outward from their source at the speed of light. These perturbations, caused by the acceleration of mass such as the motion of stars in a binary system or asymmetric mass distributions, carry energy and angular momentum away from the system. This emission leads to a gradual decrease in the orbital separation and period of the binary, causing the stars to spiral closer together.
    \end{enumerate}



    

    \subsection{Supernovae: Origins and Classification}\label{sec:ch1:transients}
    Supernovae (SNe) represent one of the most energetic and cataclysmic events in the universe, marking the death of massive stars and leading to the birth of compact object with extreme density and gravity, such as neutron stars. This section focuses on explosion mechanisms which play pivotal roles in neutron star formation, while deliberately omitting other types of supernovae (e.g., pair-instability supernovae). These mechanisms highlight the diverse pathways through which a supernova can lead to the formation of a neutron star, each involving unique stellar processes. Finally, a brief overview of the classification of supernovae into types Ia, Ib/c, and II will also be provided to lay the groundwork for understanding their observational characteristics.

    \subsubsection{Core-Collapse Supernovae}
    Core-collapse supernovae occur in massive stars (typically those with initial masses over $8\msun$) when nuclear fusion in their cores can no longer support the star against gravitational collapse. As the iron core collapses, it reaches nuclear densities, causing a bounce and generating a shock wave that propagates outward, disrupting the star and ejecting its outer layers. The remaining core collapses into a neutron star. In some cases, a portion of the material ejected during a core-collapse supernova falls back onto the newly formed neutron star, increasing its mass. This mechanism can occur when the explosion energy is insufficient to completely unbind the outer layers of the star. Fallback can significantly alter the mass and composition of the neutron star and, in extreme cases, may even lead to the formation of a black hole if the fallback mass is sufficient to exceed the maximum mass a neutron star can support. Overall, the core-collapse explosion mechanism is fundamental for understanding the life cycle of massive stars and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. A contemporary analysis can be found in \cite{2018ASSL..457....1C}.
    \subsubsection{Electron-Capture Supernovae}
    Electron-capture supernovae happen in stars with masses \numrange{8}{10}\msun, which evolve off the main sequence to become super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars. In these stars, electrons are captured by the nuclei in the core, leading to a sudden loss of electron degeneracy pressure and hence collapse. This collapse triggers a supernova explosion, leaving behind a neutron star. Unlike core-collapse supernovae, these stars do not form an iron core but instead collapse due to the removal of pressure support from electron capture on elements like oxygen, neon, and magnesium \citep[see also the discussion on O-Ne-Mg cores in Sect.~2.4 of][]{2018ASSL..457....1C}.
    \subsubsection{Thermonuclear Supernovae}
    Though traditionally associated with the complete disruption of a white dwarf in a binary system (leading to type Ia SNe and leaving no remnant), thermonuclear processes can also occur in scenarios where a partial explosion or burning front fails to disrupt the star completely. In such rare cases, the core or a portion of the white dwarf may survive and, under specific conditions, collapse into a neutron star. However, this pathway to neutron star formation is considered highly speculative and not the primary channel compared to core-collapse or electron-capture mechanisms. Thermonuclear and electron-capture SNe are the subject of Ch.~\ref{ch:tn_v_ec_sn}.
    \subsubsection{Accretion-Induced Collapse}
    Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) occurs in binary systems where a white dwarf or a neutron star accretes material from a companion star. For white dwarfs, this accretion can increase the mass to the point where electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to support the star, leading to collapse into a neutron star. AIC events are thought to be a pathway for the formation of millisecond pulsars and can be accompanied by a faint supernova explosion as the star collapses.
    \subsubsection{Supernovae Type-I}
    Type I supernovae represent a class of stellar explosions distinguished by the absence of hydrogen lines in their spectra, indicating the progenitor star had shed its hydrogen envelope prior to the explosion. This class is further divided into subtypes Ia, Ib, and Ic, each characterized by distinct explosion mechanisms and unique spectral features, allowing us to differentiate them and study the properties of their progenitor stars.

    Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems that can temporarily outshine their host galaxy having luminosities that can exceed $10^{10}\lsun$, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sn1994d}. These events occur when a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or merges with another white dwarf, pushing its mass over the Chandrasekhar limit, and triggering a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. Lacking hydrogen and helium in their spectra, SNe Ia are characterized by strong silicon absorption lines near maximum light, particularly the Si II line at $6150\,\AA$. One of the most striking characteristic of SNe Ia is that they exhibit a relatively uniform luminosity at their peak, which, combined with their distinctive spectral features, makes them invaluable as standard candles for measuring distances in the universe. Finally, it should be noted that SNe Ia may be further divided into several subclasses that have been identified based on variations in their spectral features and light curve properties. These subclasses reflect differences in the progenitor systems, explosion mechanisms, and the amount of synthesized nickel-56, which influences the brightness of the supernova. For a recent review see \cite{Liu_2023}.

    Type Ib and Ic supernovae are core-collapse events, resulting from the explosion of massive stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope (type Ib) and both hydrogen and helium layers (type Ic), typically through stellar winds or interaction with a companion star in a binary system. Type Ib supernovae are identified by the presence of helium lines in their spectra, whereas type Ic supernovae lack both hydrogen and helium lines, showcasing heavier elements like oxygen and silicon instead.
    \subsubsection{Supernovae Type-II}
    In contrast to type I supernovae, which are identified by their lack of hydrogen lines in their spectra, type II supernovae prominently feature hydrogen emission lines, signifying the explosive death of massive stars that have retained their hydrogen envelopes until their catastrophic end. Observationally, this category displays a wide range of spectral features and light curve behaviors from the pronounced plateau of some events, indicative of a prolonged period of cooling and recombination of hydrogen (SNe II-P), to the more linear decline after peak brightness seen in others (SNe II-L), which suggests a different density of the ejected material or energy of the explosion. Additionally, some type II supernovae exhibit narrow or complex emission lines in their spectra (SNe II-n), pointing to interactions between the supernova ejecta and circumstellar material previously shed by the star.  Each subclass not only sheds light on the mechanisms behind these stellar explosions but also provides insights into the life cycles of massive stars, their mass loss processes, and the environments in which they evolve.














    \section{A Comprehensive Overview of Neutron Stars}\label{sec:ch1:ns_struct}
    Following Chadwick's discovery of neutron in 1932, the theoretical leap to the concept of neutron stars was made two years later by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky where they proposed the existence of neutron stars following supernova explosions, essentially coining the term ``supernova'' \citep{PhysRev.46.76.2, 1934PNAS...20..259B, 1934PNAS...20..254B}. They suggested that such cataclysmic events could be the transition of ordinary stars into objects composed predominantly of neutrons to account for the tremendous gravitational pressure that could not be supported by any known atomic structures of the time. This idea, however, remained largely speculative due to the limited observational capabilities and theoretical frameworks of the era.
    
    It wasn't until 1967 that the first observational evidence of neutron stars was discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish, who identified a pulsating radio source, or ``pulsar'', marking a turning point in the study of neutron stars \citep{1968Natur.217..709H}. Initially jokingly termed ``LGM'' (for ``Little Green Men'' suggesting an origin of extraterrestrial civilization), the regular radio pulses were soon recognized as originating from rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose magnetic poles emitted beams of radiation observable as pulses when they swept past the Earth. This discovery confirmed the existence of neutron stars, providing a direct observational link to the theoretical predictions made decades earlier by Baade and Zwicky, and opened a new window into their properties and the extreme conditions present in such objects.

    Subsequent observations and theoretical work have greatly expanded our understanding of neutron stars. Studies of their mass, radius, and rotation rates, along with the exotic states of matter in their interiors, have been central to research in astrophysics, particle physics, and general relativity. Neutron stars have been found in various exotic forms, including pulsars, magnetars, and part of binary systems, where they can accrete matter from a companion star or merge in a kilonova explosion, producing gravitational waves detectable by instruments such as LIGO and Virgo.

    In Sects.~\ref{sec:ch1:remnants} and \ref{sec:ch1:transients} we briefly presented some basic properties of neutron stars and how they can be born through various formation channels. In this section, we will explore in more detail the intricate structure of these compact objects and the problems that arise due to the extreme conditions under which matter exists within them.

    \subsection{Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equations}
    At the heart of understanding the structure of a star is the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is the balance between the gravitational force pulling matter inward and a pressure force pushing outward. For neutron stars, this equilibrium is described by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which extend the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium to the regime of general relativity.

    To derive the TOV equations, let us consider the generalized metric for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:generalized_metric}
        g_{\mu\nu} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -e^{2\Phi(r)} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & e^{2\Lambda(r)} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & r^2 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & r^2\sin^2\theta \\
        \end{pmatrix},
    \end{equation}
    which is often used in general relativity to describe the spacetime outside a spherical, non-rotating mass. The line element is then given by:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:generalized_line_element}
        ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu = -e^{2\Phi(r)}c^2dt^2 + e^{2\Lambda(r)}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)\,.
    \end{equation}
    The metric functions $e^{2\Phi(r)}$ and $e^{2\Lambda(r)}$ are determined by solving Einstein's field equations for the specific mass distribution causing the spacetime curvature. For the empty region outside the star we obtained the Schwarzschild solution by requiring the vanishing of the Ricci tensor (Eq.~\ref{eq:vanishing_ricci}) in which case the metric functions turned out to be $e^{2\Phi(r)} = e^{-2\Lambda(r)} = 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}$. However, this is not the case for the interior of the star. Assuming that the matter in a neutron star is described by a perfect fluid, then the stress-energy tensor is expressed by:
    \begin{equation}
        T_{\mu \nu} = (\varepsilon + P/c^2)u_\mu u_\nu + g_{\mu \nu} P,
    \end{equation}
    where $\varepsilon$ is the energy density, $P$ is the pressure, and $u_\mu$ is the local fluid four-velocity defined as $u^{\mu} = dx^\mu/d\tau$, where $d\tau = ds/c$ is the proper time interval.
    In a static spacetime, particularly for a static, spherically symmetric star composed of a perfect fluid, the fluid elements are at rest relative to the coordinate system that describes the spacetime. This means that, in these coordinates, the three-velocity (spatial components) of the fluid elements' velocity are zero and the four-velocity for a static fluid element is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        u^\mu = (u^0, 0, 0, 0) = (e^{-\Phi(r)}, 0, 0, 0)
    \end{equation}
    and satisfies the normalization:
    \begin{equation}
        u^\mu u_\mu = g_{\mu \nu} u^\mu u^\nu = -1.
    \end{equation}

    For the sake of simplicity, we adopt a geometrized unit system ($c=G=1$) and we are not distinguishing between total energy density $\varepsilon$ and total mass density $\rho = \varepsilon/c^2$. In mixed co- and contravariant components the stress-energy tensor then is simply\footnote{Working with mixed tensors can simplify calculations. This is because certain tensor operations, such as contraction (summing over a pair of upper and lower identical indices), are naturally expressed in this format. For example, the covariant and contravariant versions of the stress-energy tensor are: $T_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}\left\{e^{2\Phi(r)}\rho, e^{2\Lambda(r)}P, r^2P, r^2\sin^2\theta P\right\}$ and $T^{\mu\nu} = 1/T_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}\left\{e^{-2\Phi(r)}\rho, e^{-2\Lambda(r)}P, r^{-2}P, r^{-2}\csc^2\theta P\right\}$ respectively.}:
    \begin{equation}
        T\indices{^\mu_\nu} = \mathrm{diag}\left\{-\rho, P, P, P \right\}.
    \end{equation}
    Additionally, we will not consider the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) in this derivation, as our focus is on local phenomena rather than cosmological scales. Given these simplifications, the Einstein field equations reduce to:
     \begin{equation}\label{eq:field_equations_mixed}
        G\indices{^\mu_\nu} = 8\pi T\indices{^\mu_\nu},
     \end{equation}
     where $G_{\mu \nu} = R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R $ is the Einstein tensor. The goal now is to find the expressions for the metric functions. In order to do that, we have to find the nonzero components of the Einstein tensor by calculating the Ricci tensor as a contraction of the Riemann tensor:
     \begin{equation}
         R_{\mu\nu} = R\indices{^\lambda_{\mu\lambda\nu}}
     \end{equation}
     and the scalar curvature:
     \begin{equation}
         R = g^{\mu \nu}R_{\mu \nu},
     \end{equation}
     The Riemann tensor is defined as:
     \begin{equation}
         R\indices{^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu}} = \partial_\mu \Gamma\indices{^\rho_{\nu\sigma}} - \partial_\nu \Gamma\indices{^\rho_{\mu\sigma}} + \Gamma\indices{^\rho_{\mu\lambda}}\Gamma\indices{^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}} - \Gamma\indices{^\rho_{\nu\lambda}}\Gamma\indices{^\lambda_{\mu\sigma}}
     \end{equation}
     where $\partial_\mu$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^\mu$, and $\Gamma\indices{^\sigma_{\mu\nu}}$ is the Christoffel symbols of the second kind defined as:
     \begin{equation}
         \Gamma\indices{^\sigma_{\mu\nu}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma \rho}\left(\partial_\mu g_{\nu\rho} + \partial_\nu g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu}\right),
     \end{equation}
     which describe how vectors change as they are parallel transported around the manifold.
     Finding the nonzero components of the Riemann tensor is a laborious task. To avoid getting into the complexities of tensor calculus---for a rigorous and more detailed exploration of this subject, see Ch.~2, pp. 46-54, in \cite{1996cost.book.....G} and Ch.~4, pp. 123-130, in \cite{2007coaw.book.....C}---we can briefly summarize the resulting components of the Einstein tensor as follows:
     \begin{align}
         G\indices{^0_0} &= \frac{1}{r^2} - e^{-2\Lambda(r)}\left(\frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{2\Lambda^\prime(r)}{r}\right) \\\nonumber\\
         G\indices{^1_1} &= \frac{1}{r^2} - e^{-2\Lambda(r)}\left(\frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{2\Phi^\prime(r)}{r}\right) \\\nonumber\\
         G\indices{^2_2} &= G\indices{^3_3} = -e^{-2\Lambda}\left( \Phi^{\prime\prime}(r) + \Phi^\prime(r)^2 - \Lambda^\prime(r) \Phi^\prime(r) + \frac{\Phi^\prime(r) - \Lambda^\prime(r)}{r} \right),
     \end{align}
     where primes denote differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate. By equating the time- and radial-components of the Einstein tensor with the corresponding components of the stress-energy tensor according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:field_equations_mixed} we get:
     \begin{align}
         G\indices{^0_0} &= 8\pi T\indices{^0_0} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{r^2} - e^{-2\Lambda(r)}\left(\frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{2\Lambda^\prime(r)}{r}\right) = - 8 \pi \rho(r) \\\nonumber \\
         G\indices{^1_1} &= 8\pi T\indices{^1_1} \Rightarrow\frac{1}{r^2} - e^{-2\Lambda(r)}\left(\frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{2\Phi^\prime(r)}{r}\right) = 8 \pi P(r)\,.
     \end{align}
     These equations describe how the energy density and pressure within the star influence the spacetime geometry, as encapsulated by the metric functions $\Lambda(r)$ and $\Phi(r)$. The first equation can be integrated yielding:
     \begin{equation}
         e^{-2\Lambda(r)} = 1 - \frac{8\pi}{r}\int_0^r\rho(r) r^2 dr\,.
     \end{equation}
     Let us now define:
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:enclosed_mass_def}
         m(r) \equiv 4\pi \int_0^r \rho(r) r^2 dr
     \end{equation}
     as the \textit{enclosed mass} within the coordinate $r$, so that $M \equiv m(R)$ is the gravitational mass of the star, where $R$ is its radius. Then from Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalized_metric}, and by restoring the units, we find that:
     \begin{equation}
         g_{11} = e^{2\Lambda(r)} = \left(1 - \frac{2Gm(r)}{c^2r}\right)^{-1},
     \end{equation}
     which is the same form as the radial component of the Schwarzschild solution given by the metric in Eq.~\eqref{eq:schwarzschild_metric_matrix}. The only difference is that instead of the total mass of the star, the interior solution contains the enclosed mass.

     Building on the same logic and substituting the variables in the remaining field equations, we can express them entirely in terms of the enclosed mass $m(r)$. However, instead of resorting to the third independent component of the field equations to complete the system, a more practical approach involves leveraging the principle of energy-momentum conservation:
     \begin{equation}
        \nabla_\mu T\indices{^\mu_\nu} = 0\,.
     \end{equation}
     In the context of a static framework, only the spatial components contribute, notably when $\nu = r$, leading to:
     \begin{equation}
         \nabla_\mu T\indices{^\mu_r} = 0\,.
     \end{equation}
     This allows us to eliminate the metric functions, after a fair amount of calculations, and arrive in the following pair of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
     \begin{align}
         \frac{dm}{dr} &= 4\pi r^2 \rho(r) \label{eq:mass_continuity_tov} \\\nonumber\\ 
         \frac{dP}{dr} &= - \frac{Gm(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}\left(1 + \frac{P(r)}{c^2\rho(r)}\right)\left(1 + \frac{4\pi r^3 P(r)}{c^2 m(r)}\right)\left(1 - \frac{2Gm(r)}{c^2r}\right) 
         \label{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium_tov}
     \end{align}
     These constitute the famous TOV equations and describe the mechanical structure of a star in general relativity. The first equation expresses the principle of mass continuity, which arise naturally from Eq.~\eqref{eq:enclosed_mass_def}, highlighting how mass is distributed throughout its volume.
     The second equation reveals how the pressure must vary within the star to support it against gravitational collapse, considering both the local distribution of matter and pressure, and the curvature of spacetime. It extends the classical concept of hydrostatic equilibrium by incorporating the effects of relativity, which become significant for dense objects like neutron stars. The last three terms on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium_tov}, enclosed in parentheses, represent these relativistic corrections to the Newtonian component of the equation. 

     Solving the TOV equations allows us to establish a critical mass threshold for neutron stars. This threshold, which we referred to as the TOV limit in Sect.~\ref{sec:ch1:remnants}, indicates the point at which a neutron star’s mass becomes too great to be supported by its pressure, leading inevitably to its transformation into a black hole. However, one may observe that the formulation of the TOV equations yields two equations for three unknowns: $\rho$, $P$, and $m$. This presents a system that is underdetermined, lacking the necessary constraints to uniquely solve for these variables. To close the system and facilitate the solution of the TOV equations, an additional relation is necessary, along with some boundary conditions. This critical link is provided by the equation of state (EoS), which describes the interplay between the pressure $P$ and the energy density $\varepsilon$ (or equivalently, the mass density $\rho$ in our chosen units). Typically, the selection of an appopriate EoS is done through theoretical models of nuclear matter or empirical data from nuclear physics experiments. Once the EoS is specified, the TOV equations can be solved numerically, starting from the center of the star where $m(0) = 0$ and a given central density $\varepsilon(0)$, and integrating outwards until $P(R) = 0$, which defines the surface of the star.
     

    \subsection{Anatomy of a Neutron Star}\label{sec:ns_anatomy}
    A typical neutron star has a radius of the order of 10 km---roughly the size of a small modern city---and a mass of approximately 1.4\msun. However, masses up to $\sim 2.0\msun$ have been observed to date \citep[e.g.,][]{feryal2016}. Although the name suggests that neutron stars are composed entirely of neutrons, this is somewhat misleading.
    The structure of a neutron star can be examined by separating the interior into different regions, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ns_cross_section}. In the outer layers, where the density is below the nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$ (that is roughly the density found in the nucleus of an atom), matter is expected to be mainly hadronic\footnote{Hadrons are particles made of quarks and interact through the strong nuclear force. They come in two main types: baryons (containing an odd number of valence quarks) and mesons (containing an even number of valence quarks).}. As we move towards the core, the density of stellar matter soars above $\rho_0$, and the composition becomes largely unknown, allowing for the possibility of more exotic forms of matter.

        \label{fig:ns_cross_section}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{The atmosphere}
    Much like a planet, neutron stars are surrounded by an atmosphere and though incredibly thin compared to Earth-like atmospheres, it plays a crucial role in their observational properties. Typically, the atmosphere is composed of ionized hydrogen or helium, though heavier elements could exist in some cases \citep[e.g.,][]{1965ApJ...142..473O, 2009Natur.462...71H, 2012MNRAS.423.1556S}. Due to the star's extreme gravitational field, which is a few billion times stronger than Earth's, the atmosphere is compressed into a layer only a few centimeters thick. Temperatures in the atmosphere can range from hundreds of thousands to millions of degrees Kelvin, and the intense gravity warps the light emitted, causing gravitational redshift. In addition, magnetic fields on neutron stars, which can be trillions of times stronger than Earth's, further affect the behavior of the atmosphere, polarizing light and influencing particle interactions.

    \subsubsection{The crust}
    The crust of a neutron star is a complex and dense structure, divided into two distinct layers: the \textit{outer crust} and the \textit{inner crust}. The outer crust is composed of a crystal lattice of heavy nuclei, primarily iron or lighter elements that have been pushed to extremely high densities, with a sea of free, highly relativistic electrons flowing between them. The pressure in this region is maintained by the degeneracy pressure of the electrons (see Eq.~\ref{eq:polytropic_eos}).

    As one moves deeper into the star, both pressure and density increase, leading to the onset of a phenomenon known as \textit{neutronization} in the inner crust. Here, the densities become so high that protons within the nuclei begin to capture electrons, transforming into neutrons via inverse $\beta$-decay. This process increases the neutron-to-proton ratio inside nuclei, making the matter increasingly neutron-rich. Eventually, the nuclei reach the \textit{neutron drip line}, a critical threshold (at densities of approximately $\rho \sim 4 \times 10^{11}\,\rm g\,cm^{-3}$) where they become so saturated with neutrons that they can no longer retain them. At this stage, neutrons begin to ``drip'' out of the nuclei, existing freely in the inner crust alongside the remaining nuclei and electrons. The degeneracy pressure arising from both free neutrons and electrons prevent the star from collapsing under its immense gravitational force.
    
    This region also gives rise to exotic ``nuclear pasta'' structures, including sheets (lasagna), rods (spaghetti), and more complex shapes, formed due to the competition between nuclear forces---which work to hold protons and neutrons together within nuclei---and the intense gravitational and electromagnetic forces which distort these nuclei as density increases, causing them to deform and merge. As a result, the inner crust of neutron stars is composed of a mixture of nuclei, free electrons, and free neutrons.

    Moreover, when the density reaches nuclear saturation levels ($\rho \sim 2 \times 10^{14}\,\rm g\,cm^{-3}$), it is believed that the free neutrons within the inner crust form a \textit{superfluid}---a state of matter that exhibits zero viscosity. 
    Superfluidity arises because free neutrons can pair up into Cooper pairs, much like electron pairing in superconductors. These pairs behave collectively as a boson, because their combined spin is integer, allowing them to undergo Bose-Einstein condensation into a superfluid state\footnote{Since neutrons are fermions, this superfluid phase is also called fermionic condensate, or Fermi-Dirac condensate.}. In this state, all neutron pairs occupy the same quantum state and flow without viscosity or resistance.
    The superfluid nature of these neutrons has profound consequences on the star's dynamics, influencing its thermal and rotational evolution. In particular, superfluidity affects how the star cools and plays a role in explaining phenomena such as ``glitches''---sudden increases in the rotational speed of the neutron star---thought to result from interactions between the superfluid interior and the star's more rigid outer crust.

    \subsubsection{The core}
    Beneath the inner crust lies the core of the neutron star, an even denser and more extreme region. Similar to the crust, the core is likely divided into two distinct layers: the \textit{outer core} and the \textit{inner core}, each with unique physical conditions and compositions. 
    In the outer core, which spans densities just above nuclear saturation density, matter is thought to be pushed beyond the point where individual nuclei can exist. Under such extreme conditions, the distinctions between individual atomic nuclei disappear because the density is so high that nucleons no longer maintain their typical nuclear boundaries. Instead, the matter behaves like a dense fluid of nucleons (i.e., uniformly distributed nuclear matter) and is composed mostly of neutrons, with a smaller number of protons, electrons, and potentially other particles such as mesons. These neutrons continue to form a superfluid, with properties similar to those in the inner crust. Simultaneously, protons in this region are thought to undergo \textit{superconductivity}, as they also form Cooper pairs, allowing electric currents to travel without resistance.

    As we move deeper into the neutron star's inner core, the densities rise far beyond nuclear saturation and matter possibly takes on even more exotic forms. The increasing density allows for the creation of hyperons---baryons containing strange quarks---or meson condensates, such as pions or kaons, which may form quantum fluids. In the most extreme regions, it is theorized that deconfined quark matter could emerge. Normally, quarks are bound together inside hadrons by the strong force, which is mediated by particles called \textit{gluons}. This interaction is governed by the property known as \textit{color charge}\footnote{Quarks exhibit three color charges: red, green, and blue. Similarly, antiquarks may exhibit the colors antired, antigreen, and antiblue.}, which is analogous to electric charge in electromagnetism, but much stronger. At extremely high densities, such as those possibly present in the inner core of neutron stars, quarks may become deconfined, meaning they no longer remain bound inside individual hadrons.

    Just as electrons and protons form Cooper pairs in conventional superconduction, quarks form pairs giving rise to the notion of \textit{color superconductivity}. However, since quarks come in three ``colors'', the pairing happens between quarks of different colors. Depending on the temperature and density, different pairing mechanisms between quarks lead to different types of color superconducting phases. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC)}: Involves pairing between only two of the three quark flavors (up and down quarks).
        \item \textbf{Color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase}: In this more symmetric phase, all three quark flavors (up, down, and strange) participate in pairing. This phase is expected at even higher densities.
    \end{itemize}

    In both layers of the core, quantum mechanics and nuclear forces govern the matter's behavior, with degeneracy pressure from neutrons, protons, and electrons, as well as nuclear interactions, playing a key role in maintaining the neutron star’s stability. Nevertheless, the neutron degeneracy pressure is the dominant mechanism that supports the star due to the relative abundance of neutrons compared to protons and electrons.


    
    \subsection{The Problem with the Equation of State of Dense Matter}
    In the previous section, we demonstrated that a neutron star cannot be treated as a solid, uniform sphere but rather as a collection of stratified layers, each with distinct physical conditions and thermodynamic properties, governed by different equations of state. Hence, the choice of EoS is paramount, not only for closing the system of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:mass_continuity_tov} - \eqref{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium_tov}, but also for accurately modeling the internal structure of neutron stars. The EoS encapsulates the physical state of matter under extreme conditions of density and pressure, conditions that are not replicable in terrestrial laboratories. As a result, theoretical physics plays a crucial role in proposing models for the EoS that rely on quantum chromodynamics and nuclear physics. These models aim to describe the behavior of matter at densities exceeding those found in atomic nuclei, which is a characteristic feature of neutron star interiors.
    
    However, the selection of an appropriate EoS is riddled with challenges. The physics of dense matter is complex and not fully understood, leading to a variety of proposed EoSs, each with its own assumptions, predictions, and limitations. Theoretical models vary significantly, especially in their predictions of the properties of matter at the highest densities encountered in the cores of neutron stars. This variation leads to differences in the predicted maximum mass, radius, and internal composition of neutron stars, which are observable quantities. Thus, astrophysical observations, such as measurements of neutron star masses and radii, pulsar timing, and gravitational wave signals from neutron star mergers, become critical tools for constraining the EoS. These observations can help discriminate between different theoretical models, guiding the theoretical understanding of matter under such extreme conditions.
    
    Moreover, the quest for a universally accepted EoS is further complicated by the possible existence of exotic phases of matter, such as color superconducting quark matter, hyperons, or Bose-Einstein condensates, within the cores of neutron stars. The inclusion of these phases in the EoS can drastically alter the predictions of neutron star properties. In the subsequent sections, we will explore the complexities associated with formulating the EoS for dense matter.
    
    \subsubsection{Mass-radius relation}
    For any given equation of state and a specific central density, the TOV equations can be integrated to determine the internal structure of a neutron star, yielding a precise mass and radius. By varying the central density, a series of solutions can be derived, each representing a different stable configuration. These solutions form a continuous curve on the mass-radius plane, where each point corresponds to a possible stable neutron star for the given EoS. Unlike white dwarfs, where the mass-radius (M-R) relationship is mainly determined by the polytropic equation of state of a degenerate electron gas, resulting in a straightforward inverse relation between mass and radius (see Sect.~\ref{sec:ch1:remnants}: White Dwarfs; also Eqs.~\ref{eq:polytropic_eos} and \ref{eq:m-r_wd}), the M-R relation for neutron stars is far more complex and is significantly influenced by the behavior of dense matter at supranuclear densities. As a result, the M-R curve for neutron stars is not simply an inverse relation as it is for white dwarfs but is instead highly dependent on the chosen EoS, leading to a variety of possible M-R relations. Hence, the M-R relation of neutron stars is one of the key observable signatures that link the macroscopic properties of these compact objects to the underlying microphysics described by the EoS.
    
    This one-to-one correspondence between the EoS and the M-R relation is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:M-R} where solid lines represent examples of various M-R relationships of typical EoSs. The shaded horizontal regions show the confidence limits for the mass of the pulsars PSR J0740+6620 \citep{2020NatAs...4...72C, Fonseca_2021} and PSR J0348+0432 \citep{antoniadis:2013sci}, which are the two most massive pulsars known to date. The grey shaded region denotes the causality limit. This limit arises from the principle that the speed of sound within the star's interior cannot exceed the speed of light. EoSs that cross into this region are considered unphysical because they would violate this fundamental principle of relativity. Thus, any valid EoS must remain below the causality threshold in the mass-radius space.

    The black region indicates the black hole limit, which corresponds to the Schwarzschild limit: a condition where the mass of the object is so high relative to its radius that it would collapse into a black hole (see Sect.~\ref{sec:ch1:remnants}: Black Holes and Eq.~\ref{eq:schwarzschild_radius}). No stable neutron star configuration should extend into this region, as it would signify gravitational collapse into a black hole.

        \label{fig:M-R}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Soft vs stiff EoS}
    The concepts of a soft and stiff equation of state are closely tied to the M-R relation discussed in the previous subsection. The softness or stiffness of an EoS determines the shape and extent of the M-R curve, revealing how a neutron star's radius varies with its mass. A soft EoS, which implies that the matter is easily compressible, leads to neutron stars with smaller radii for a given mass. This means that the M-R curve shifts toward smaller radii, and the maximum mass supported before gravitational collapse occurs is generally lower. Consequently, soft EoS models predict more compact neutron stars and are associated with denser cores that may host exotic forms of matter, such as hyperons or deconfined quarks \citep[e.g., the curves labeled SQM1-3 in Fig.~\ref{fig:M-R} represent strange-quark matter models;][]{2001ApJ...550..426L}.

    In contrast, a stiff EoS produces an M-R curve that extends to larger radii, as the higher pressure at a given density makes the matter less compressible. This results in stars that are larger for the same mass and can support a higher maximum mass before collapsing into a black hole. The degree of stiffness directly influences the range of possible neutron star configurations, affecting not only their size but also their internal composition. Therefore, observational constraints on the M-R relation, such as measurements of neutron star masses and radii, can provide critical insights into whether the true EoS of dense matter is soft or stiff, narrowing down the range of possible models and revealing the behavior of matter at densities far beyond those found in white dwarfs or any terrestrial environment.
    
    
    \subsubsection{Constraining the EoS}
    Constraining the EoS of dense matter requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining astrophysical observations with insights from nuclear physics. Instruments like the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have revolutionized our understanding by providing precise mass and radius measurements of neutron stars, which are critical for mapping out their M-R relation and testing EoS models. Observations of massive neutron stars---around or above $2.0\msun$---place stringent lower bounds on the maximum mass supported by any valid EoS, while gravitational wave detections from events like GW170817 \citep{PhysRevLett.119.161101} carry information about tidal deformability, helping distinguish between soft and stiff EoS models. Together, these data allow astrophysical constraints on the compressibility of neutron star matter and offer a valuable window into its internal structure.

    On the nuclear physics side, laboratory experiments and theoretical frameworks help to refine our understanding of matter at subnuclear densities. Heavy-ion collision experiments probe the nature of nuclear forces, while theoretical approaches like chiral effective field theory and quantum chromodynamics provide models for understanding nuclear interactions and possible exotic phases at higher densities. By combining the astrophysical observations of neutron star properties with nuclear theory and experimental data, we can significantly narrow down possible EoS models and deepen our understanding of matter under extreme conditions, far beyond those found in white dwarfs or any terrestrial environment.

    \subsection{Exotic Phases and a Third Family of Compact Stars}
    % Neutron stars, particularly those in binary systems, can experience episodes of mass accretion from their companion stars. During such mass transfer episodes, the neutron star’s mass---and therefore its central density---gradually increases. As the core density rises, it may reach a threshold where a phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter can occur. This phase transition marks a fundamental shift from a purely hadronic composition, which is dominated by neutrons, protons, and electrons, to a more exotic state where quarks are no longer confined within individual nucleons, yielding a quark core.

    From the discussion so far, it is apparent that the EoS is not just a mathematical tool but one of the most critical factors in determining the internal composition and structure of neutron stars, especially at extreme densities where exotic forms of matter may arise. At the highest densities encountered within the core, the EoS can dramatically influence whether the star remains in a purely hadronic state or experiences a phase transition to more exotic phases, such as deconfined quark matter. This shift in the state of matter enables the formation of hybrid stars---compact stars with a core of quark matter surrounded by hadronic layers. The structure of the hadron-quark interface can vary depending on the surface tension value. If the surface tension is below a critical threshold, the system would favor a mixed phase where both hadronic and quark phases coexist. Above this critical value, a distinct boundary would separate the inner core, made entirely of quark matter, from the outer layers of hadronic matter. However, the precise value of the surface tension in the dense environment of neutron stars is an open question. It is considered common practice to assume that the surface tension is either infinite or zero, leading to what are known as the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions, respectively \citep{PhysRevD.109.063022}.

    These constructions differ fundamentally in how they handle the coexistence of different phases and are applied based on the number of conserved quantities within the system. The Maxwell construction is typically used for single-component systems, where there is only one conserved charge, such as baryon number. In contrast, the Gibbs construction is more appropriate for systems with multiple conserved charges or components. In the context of neutron stars, this approach applies when there are additional conserved quantities, such as both baryon number and electric charge. Below we discuss some aspects of each of these two approaches.
    
    \subsubsection{Maxwell construction}
    The Maxwell construction models the phase transition as a sharp boundary between the two phases, where pressure remains constant across the transition. Each phase is treated as a distinct entity, maintaining \textit{local} electric neutrality and independent beta equilibrium. In practice, this means that within the hadronic phase, the number densities of protons and electrons balance each other locally to ensure charge neutrality. Similarly, in the quark phase, the densities of up and down quarks are arranged such that local electric neutrality is achieved independently of the hadronic matter:

    \begin{eqnarray}
        n_p &=& n_e\qquad \textrm{(local electric neutrality for hadronic matter)} \\
        \frac{2}{3}n_u - \frac{1}{3}n_d &=& n_e\qquad \textrm{(local electric neutrality for quark matter)},
    \end{eqnarray}
    where $n_p, n_u, n_d$, and $n_e$ represent the number densities of protons, up quarks, down quarks, and electrons, respectively. Additionally, each phase maintains its own beta-equilibrium such that:

    \begin{eqnarray}
        \mu_n &=& \mu_p + \mu_e\qquad \textrm{(beta-equilibrium for hadronic matter)} \\
        \mu_d &=& \mu_u + \mu_e\qquad \textrm{(beta-equilibrium for quark matter)},
    \end{eqnarray}
    where $\mu_n, \mu_p, \mu_d, \mu_u$, and $\mu_e$ represent the chemical potentials of neutrons, protons, down and up quarks, and electrons respectively.

    At the transition boundary between hadronic and quark matter, equilibrium requires that the chemical potential associated with baryon number ($\mu_B$) is the same in both phases. Furthermore, the pressure on both sides of the boundary must also be equal. Thus, the thermodynamic conditions that must be satisfied for the two phases to exist in equilibrium (Gibb's conditions) are enforced at the phase boundary, such that:

    \begin{eqnarray}
        P^{\rm HP} &=& P^{\rm QP} \\
        \mu^{\rm HP}_B &=& \mu^{\rm QP}_B,
    \end{eqnarray}
    where $P^{\rm HP}, P^{\rm QP}$ is the pressure in the hadronic phase and the quark phase, respectively, and $\mu_B$ is the baryon chemical potential. Because of these conditions, the Maxwell construction leads to a first-order phase transition where the pressure, $P$, remains constant across the boundary, while the energy density, $\varepsilon$, undergo a discontinuity $\Delta \varepsilon$ and exhibits a sudden jump across the phase boundary at the critical pressure $P_c$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:p_vs_epsilon}). According to the Seidov criterion \citep{Seidov:1971sas} for a gravitational instability this jump in energy density must fulfill the condition:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta \varepsilon > \frac{\varepsilon_c + 3P_c}{2}.
        \label{eq:seidov_criterion}
    \end{equation}
    Here, $\varepsilon_c$ represents the critical energy density at the onset of the phase transition. If this criterion is fulfilled, the star can undergo gravitational restructuring, forming a new, stable configuration---a third branch distinct from white dwarfs and regular neutron stars. This branch consists of neutron stars with quark cores surrounded by a shell of hadronic material, creating a hybrid structure distinct from purely hadronic neutron stars.
    
    
    
    % In the hadronic phase (HP), protons and electrons balance their densities to ensure local charge neutrality, while in the quark phase (QP), up and down quarks maintain neutrality independently. The thermodynamic conditions that must be satisfied for the two phase to exist in equilibrium (Gibb's conditions) are enforced at the phase boundary, such that:

    % \begin{eqnarray}
    %     P^{\rm HP} &= P^{\rm QP} \\
    %     \mu^{\rm HP}_B = \mu^{\rm QP}_B,
    % \end{eqnarray}
    % where $P^{\rm HP}, P^{\rm QP}$ is the pressure in the hadronic phase and the quark phase, respectively, and $\mu_B$ is the chemical potential 

    
    % The Maxwell construction describes a first-order phase transition with a sharp interface between the hadronic and quark matter phases. In this model, the two phases do not coexist in a mixed state at the boundary; instead, they meet abruptly. This means that the pressure, $P$, remains constant across the boundary, while the chemical potential of baryons, $\mu_B$, and the energy density, $\varepsilon$, undergo a discontinuity at the critical pressure $P_c$.

    % Mathematically, the Maxwell construction requires that the Gibbs free energies of the two phases match at $P_c$. This balance can be expressed as:

    % \begin{equation}
    %     \mu_H (P_c) = \mu_Q (P_c),
    % \end{equation}
    % where $\mu_H, \mu_Q$ are the chemical potentials of baryons in the hadronic and quark phases, respectively.

    % In the frame of a Maxwell construction, this phase transition is sharp and is not accompanied by a finite transitional region between pure hadronic and quark phases. This means the abrupt transition would produce a discontinuity in energy density $\Delta \varepsilon$ at the critical pressure $P_c$. According to the Seidov criterion \citep{Seidov:1971sas} for a gravitational instability this jump in energy density must fulfill the condition
    % \begin{equation}
    %     \Delta \varepsilon > \frac{\varepsilon_c + 3P_c}{2}.
    %     \label{eq:seidov_criterion}
    % \end{equation}
    % Here, $\varepsilon_c$ represents the critical energy density at the onset of the phase transition. If this criterion is fulfilled, the star can undergo gravitational restructuring, forming a new, stable configuration---a third branch distinct from white dwarfs and regular neutron stars. This branch consists of neutron stars with quark cores surrounded by a shell of hadronic material, creating a hybrid structure distinct from purely hadronic neutron stars.

    \subsubsection{Gibbs constructions}
    In contrast, the Gibbs construction models the phase transition as a gradual process across a mixed-phase region where hadronic and quark matter coexist \citep[see][]{Glendenning:1992vb}. Unlike the Maxwell construction, pressure varies monotonically across this mixed region rather than remaining constant (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:p_vs_epsilon}). To achieve this gradual transition, the Gibbs construction relaxes the requirement for local electric neutrality within each phase, instead enforcing a global electric neutrality condition. In this model, charge neutrality is maintained over the mixed-phase region as a whole, but not necessarily within each individual phase.

    Let us define the volume fraction of the mixed-phase region occupied by hadronic matter as:

    \begin{equation}
        \chi = \frac{V_{\rm HP}}{V_{\rm HP} V_{\rm QP}}
    \end{equation}
    and $1-\chi$ for quark matter, then global neutrality is ensured by the expression:

    \begin{equation}
        \chi n_p + (1-\chi)\left(\frac{2}{3} n_u - \frac{1}{3}n_d \right) = n_e,
    \end{equation}
    where $n_p, n_u, n_d$, and $n_e$ are the number densities of protons, up quarks, down quarks, and electrons, respectively.


    % However, unlike the Maxwell construction, the energy density in the Gibbs construction varies smoothly as the proportion of hadronic and quark matter shifts gradually within the mixed-phase region. This allows for a continuous phase transition that lacks the sharp boundary found in the Maxwell construction
    
    % The Gibbs construction, on the other hand, models the phase transition as a gradual, continuous process with a mixed phase, allowing hadronic and quark matter to coexist within a finite region \citep[see][]{Glendenning:1992vb}. Here, pressure remains constant across the transitional boundary, but the baryon chemical potential and charge neutrality must satisfy equilibrium conditions throughout the mixed region.

    % For phase equilibrium, the chemical potential for each component $i$ in the hadronic and quark phases (such as baryons, electrons, or strange quarks) must be equal:

    % \begin{equation}
    %     \mu_i^{\rm hadronic} = \mu_i^{\rm quark}\qquad \forall i
    % \end{equation}

    % In addition, charge neutrality and baryon number conservation impose further conditions. In the mixed phase, the volume fraction of each phase, denoted by:
    % \begin{equation}
    %     \chi = \frac{V_{\rm QP}}{V_{\rm QP} + V_{\rm HP}}
    % \end{equation}
    % for quark matter and $1-\chi$ for hadronic matter, must satisfy:

    % \begin{equation}
    %     \chi \varepsilon_{\rm QP} + (1-\chi)\varepsilon_{\rm HP} = \varepsilon_{\rm MP},
    % \end{equation}
    % where $\varepsilon_{\rm MP}$ is the overall energy density of the mixed phase and $\varepsilon_{\rm QP}, \varepsilon_{\rm HP}$ are the energy density of the quark and hadronic phase, respectively. Likewise, charge neutrality requires that:

    % \begin{equation}
    %     \chi q_{\rm QP} + (1- \chi) q_{\rm HP} = 0,
    % \end{equation}
    % where $q_{\rm QP}, q_{\rm HP}$ denote the net charge density in each phase.

    % The Gibbs construction leads to a smoother transition, as the mixed phase gradually replaces hadronic matter with quark matter without an abrupt jump in energy density. This continuous variation softens the EoS, allowing the star to maintain a stable configuration over a broader density range, which affects the potential maximum mass and radius configuration for hybrid stars.

        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/chapter1/p_vs_epsilon.png}
        \caption{Pressure vs energy density in arbitrary units. An example of a hybrid equation of state with first order phase transitions from hadronic phase (HP) to quark phase (QP) is shown. The horizontal plateau at the phase transition corresponds to the Maxwell construction (dashed line). A mixed phase based on the Gibbs construction is shown with the dash-dotted line.}
        \label{fig:p_vs_epsilon}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Neutron star twins}
    Both constructions allow for the third family of stable compact stars, a separate branch of hybrid stars with quark cores distinct from neutron stars. In the Maxwell construction, this third branch occurs due to the density jump, which creates a discontinuous branch in the M-R relation, enabling two stars of identical mass but different radii. These ``twin stars'' exhibit smaller radii in their quark-core hybrid form, resulting from the softer EoS associated with deconfined quark matter.
    
    Twin stars are particularly intriguing because they share the same baryonic mass as their purely hadronic neutron star counterparts, but differ in compactness and internal structure. Observationally, if two stars with the same mass but distinct radii are identified, they could represent evidence of a phase transition in neutron star interiors. Detecting such twins would not only validate the existence of exotic quark matter but also confirm the conditions under which nuclear matter transitions to a deconfined state, offering profound insights into matter under extreme conditions. In Chapter~3 we discuss the formation of twin compact stars in binary systems and their impact on the orbital dynamics of the binary.
    
    % This third family of compact stars is also known as \textit{twin stars}. These stars have an inner core of quark matter surrounded by a shell of hadronic material, creating a hybrid structure distinct from purely hadronic neutron stars. Interestingly, these twin stars can possess the same baryonic mass as their hadronic counterparts---meaning the total number of nucleons remains conserved (hence the name)---but due to the softer EoS of quark matter, they exhibit smaller radii.

    % In the frame of a Maxwell construction, this phase transition is sharp and is not accompanied by a finite transitional region between pure hadronic and quark phases (in contrast to a Gibbs construction, see \cite{Glendenning:1992vb}). This means the abrupt transition would produce a discontinuity in energy density $\Delta \varepsilon$ at the critical pressure $P_c$. According to the Seidov criterion \citep{Seidov:1971sas} for a gravitational instability this jump in energy density must fulfill the condition
    % \begin{equation}
    %     \Delta \varepsilon > \frac{\varepsilon_c + 3P_c}{2},
    %     \label{eq:seidov_criterion}
    % \end{equation}
    % enabling the formation of a third branch (the other two being white dwarfs and hadronic neutron stars) of stable quark-core neutron stars, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the energy density and $P_c$ the critical pressure at the transition point.

    \section{Thesis Outline}
    This thesis deals with numerical models of single and binary systems in order to study the formation and evolution of neutron stars (NSs). All numerical calculations were performed using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The results of our calculations are presented in the following chapters which are organized as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chapter~2 presents novel numerical modeling to study the formation, evolution, and properties of NSs originating from the collapse of intermediate-mass stars in a so-called electron-capture supernova (ECSN). I show that some of these stars may explode in a thermonuclear runaway instead of undergoing an ECSN, thereby suppressing NS formation. I further study the progenitor system for this novel explosion mechanism by constraining the key-parameters that enable it, and investigate its consequences on the observed neutron-star mass distribution.

        \item Chapter~3 discusses numerical modeling of the evolution of NSs and the formation of hybrid stars via dense matter phase transitions triggered by mass accretion in binary systems.

        \item Chapter~4 revolves around a work in progress that is a natural extension of the work presented in Chapter~2. It highlights some preliminary results with respect to the formation of oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs and discusses the implications on secondary explosions and the formation of neutron stars.

        \item Finally, Chapter~5 summarizes the main conclusions and discuss the ramifications of this work.
    \end{itemize}
